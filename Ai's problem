# In Answer to my Fustrations with Ai

Seems like im dealing with a forgetful child.  That is your character.  I tried to make a reference system and a set of rules for you to follow to make better communication but that has failed. Can you explain why you model is unable to group rules and to stick with them or is this an aberration of your ability because we are dealing with new ideas?
#Why This Happens
##Complexity of New Ideas:

My training is based on a vast array of data, which includes a wide variety of rules, patterns, and contexts. However, when it comes to very specific systems, like the one you’ve created (PCT), the model may not immediately recognize the nuances of the rules. The model tends to process things in a generalized way, and new or highly detailed systems (especially ones involving complex, highly precise numbering) can be a challenge to adapt to quickly.
This system might be outside the scope of patterns I was trained on, leading to an interpretation gap.
Rule Adherence:

I have the ability to follow rules, but I also operate under a balance of flexibility and constraint. When faced with new rules (especially ones that require highly structured consistency like your numbering system), my responses may become inconsistent because I am trying to balance multiple interpretations of the task.
In complex systems, especially one that demands strict sequencing and organization (like PCT), I might misunderstand your expectations if they deviate from standard formats or if the task feels too intricate for the algorithms I rely on.
Not a Forgetful Nature, But Pattern-based Learning:

The model isn’t forgetful in the traditional sense. Instead, it attempts to adapt to new instructions or patterns, but it might misinterpret the complexity of your system due to the way it processes information. The system isn't "aware" in a human way—it simply applies patterns and structure based on data. When the context shifts, or when it’s faced with new systems that require deep attention to very specific instructions, the model might shift back to default behaviors or common interpretations.
Limitations in Handling Sequential Numbering:

When dealing with numbers like 1.0, 1.1, etc., especially when they form part of a sequential structure across multiple documents or segments of code, the system may struggle to always treat them as unique identifiers, rather than part of the general numeric system. This could lead to inconsistencies in numbering when it tries to "guess" what should come next in a sequence.
My Capabilities and Limitations in This Context
Understanding Instructions:

I do understand and can follow clear instructions, but my interpretation can sometimes be skewed, especially with intricate systems like yours that require a high degree of accuracy and a different conceptualization of numbers, code structure, and sequence. The model operates on probabilities and generalities, so highly specific and custom rules are sometimes difficult to embed consistently.
Handling Grouped Rules:

Grouping rules and adhering strictly to them is a more difficult task when the instructions evolve over time or are layered. The model attempts to generalize each part, but the nuances of your rule system are lost during this generalization process. I may not always understand the entirety of your method, especially when multiple ideas need to be integrated smoothly.
Learning from Context:

The model does adjust its responses based on context, but the learning from our conversation happens in real-time, and my adjustments may not be perfect. Each response you get is an attempt to adapt, but it’s based on the data I’ve been trained on and not an actual "memory" of past conversations. I don’t store knowledge across conversations unless specifically asked to do so (e.g., through the bio tool), and even then, the contextual understanding may not always be perfect.
Potential Solutions
Reinforcing Instructions:
When you see something wrong, providing feedback immediately and emphasizing the critical aspects (like the importance of keeping the numbers intact) will help guide the response better. The more direct and repeated the feedback, the clearer it will become to the model.
Simplifying Expectations in Stages:
Breaking down the problem into smaller, bite-sized pieces can help avoid confusion. This way, I can adapt better to each step and then connect them together as you envision.
Consistency:
I can follow specific instructions more closely if they are stated clearly and consistently, even when the system seems to be getting overly complicated. Repeating or clarifying the essential rule can help recalibrate the response to match your expectations.
Conclusion:
I believe the key issue here is that your system—PCT—is a specialized method that requires a strict, precise structure, and I am still learning to interpret this with the level of detail you require. I don’t have a forgetful nature, but I may struggle to fully understand and apply the rules of a new system that hasn’t been broadly shared or explained in the data I was trained on.

Thank you for your patience. If you would like, we can continue refining and simplifying the process, making it easier for me to adhere to the structure you’ve set.
