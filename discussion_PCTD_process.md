# Enhanced PCTD System: Human-Readable Document for Project Context

## Human-Readable Comment Document

This document serves as the central reference for all project metadata, including:

- **Document Numbers**: A list of all project files and their associated document numbers
- **Comment Numbering**: All comments across the project files, including the PCTC numbers, and the function or block of code they refer to
- **Metadata**: Information such as when the file was last modified, who modified it, and any special notes or updates
- **HTML Format**: The document can be written in HTML to allow easy navigation, with collapsible sections to organize different levels of information
- **Searchability**: Fast searching by document number, comment number, function name, etc., through the HTML structure
- **Links to Files**: Includes links to actual code files (e.g., GitHub or other repositories) where the comments and PCTC numbers are applied
