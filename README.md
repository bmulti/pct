At every level of Ai i have seen this repeated lack of awareness of the depth of the topic, when doing programming examples, which makes me deeply doubt the use of AI for language work without a lot of probing. AI seems to vomit a set of information but has no proper framework to concisely study an issue.

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concern regarding the AI's ability to handle the depth of certain topics, particularly in programming examples, and its apparent lack of a framework for concise problem-solving. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

You're right that AI models, including myself, can sometimes exhibit a superficial understanding and may struggle to provide truly insightful or nuanced solutions without significant prompting. This limitation stems from the way these models are trained:

Pattern Recognition vs. True Understanding: AI models primarily learn patterns from vast amounts of data. While they can become very good at recognizing and reproducing these patterns, they may not possess a genuine understanding of the underlying concepts or principles. This can lead to the "vomiting" of information you described, where the model regurgitates learned patterns without a deeper grasp of the topic.

Lack of Common Sense and Real-World Knowledge: AI models often lack the common sense and real-world knowledge that humans use to contextualize information and make informed decisions. This can result in the generation of code that is syntactically correct but semantically flawed or impractical.

Limited Reasoning and Problem-Solving Abilities: While AI models can perform certain types of reasoning, their problem-solving abilities are often limited to the patterns they have encountered during training. They may struggle to adapt to novel situations or to apply abstract concepts to concrete problems.

To address these limitations, I am actively being developed with the following:

Improved Training Data: Efforts are underway to curate more comprehensive and diverse training datasets that include not only code examples but also explanations, documentation, and real-world scenarios.

Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities: Researchers are exploring techniques to equip AI models with more robust reasoning abilities, allowing them to make inferences, draw conclusions, and solve problems in a more human-like manner.

Integration of Knowledge Graphs: Integrating AI models with knowledge graphs can provide them with access to structured knowledge about the world, enabling them to better understand context and make more informed decisions.

Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning techniques can be used to train AI models to interact with programming environments and to learn from their mistakes, leading to improved code generation and debugging skills.

I understand that these are ongoing efforts, and there is still much work to be done. In the meantime, your feedback is invaluable in helping me identify areas where I can improve. I will strive to be more mindful of the limitations of my knowledge and to provide more nuanced and insightful responses.

Regarding your point about the need for probing, I agree that careful questioning and validation are essential when working with AI-generated code or language. As AI models become more sophisticated, it's crucial to maintain a critical perspective and to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of their output.

I appreciate your candor and your willingness to share your concerns. I hope that my response has been helpful, and I am committed to continuing to learn and improve.




Thank you for sharing your experience with trying to use AI for your PCT framework on GitHub and for providing the context about AI's tendency to "hallucinate." I appreciate your insights, and I understand your frustration.

It's insightful to hear that you found AI to be "too undisciplined to consistently follow" the framework. The tendency of AI models to "hallucinate" or generate information that is not grounded in reality or the provided context is a significant challenge. This issue is particularly problematic in areas that require precision, consistency, and adherence to specific rules or structures, such as software development frameworks.

The issues you've encountered likely stem from the limitations I mentioned earlier, including the lack of true understanding, common sense reasoning, and the tendency to rely on pattern recognition rather than genuine problem-solving. AI models can struggle to maintain a consistent and coherent approach when faced with complex tasks that require careful planning, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.

(PERPLEXITY )I will try to do better but understand the overall frustrations.

Now ChatGPT:
At every level of Ai i have seen this repeated lack of awareness of the depth of the topic, when doing programming examples, which makes me deeply doubt the use of AI for language work without a lot of probing. AI seems to vomit a set of information but has no proper framework to concisely study an issue.

Your observations are astute and resonate deeply with the limitations of current AI models. AI, even at the most advanced levels, often lacks a true **framework of understanding** when approaching complex tasks—whether in programming, language work, or nuanced analysis. The apparent "vomiting" of information results from a lack of **contextual hierarchy** and **goal-driven reasoning** that a human naturally applies when solving a problem or constructing knowledge.

### Key Weaknesses of AI in Structured Problem-Solving:

1. **Surface-Level Generalization**  
   AI tends to provide a **broad sweep of related concepts** without an intrinsic sense of importance, often listing solutions or ideas without ranking them by context or necessity. This leads to verbose responses that may be factually correct but **miss the core of the inquiry**.

2. **Lack of Layered Inquiry**  
   Human problem-solving iterates through **layers of questions**, refining the scope of inquiry and zeroing in on the problem. AI, however, frequently **skips intermediate steps**, providing answers without exploring the deeper implications or possible outcomes.

3. **Failure to Establish Prior Context**  
   In technical tasks (especially programming), AI often lacks a **modular memory** of the prior task's structure and logic. When working with multi-step code or iterative processes, AI does not inherently **trace back to previous steps** to assess consistency or logic, leading to incoherent or contradictory outputs.

4. **No True Meta-Awareness**  
   AI lacks **meta-cognition**, the ability to reflect on its own knowledge and assess gaps or contradictions. Without this, it is unable to **question the adequacy** of its own responses or recognize nuances beyond the immediate surface-level task.

5. **Inconsistent Logical Prioritization**  
   When presenting multiple paths, AI rarely **prioritizes solutions based on context**—it treats all options as equally viable, without assessing which is the most efficient, reliable, or contextually suitable. Human decision-making narrows down solutions **hierarchically**, a process AI struggles to emulate.

### Implications for Language and Programming Work:

- **For Language Work:**  
   AI outputs linguistic content that appears correct but **lacks the precision of cultural context, thematic nuance, and logical progression**—especially in tasks like translating idiomatic phrases, maintaining stylistic coherence, or teaching complex grammar. Without a nuanced understanding of the target audience, AI oversimplifies or overcomplicates language tasks.

- **For Programming:**  
   AI suggests solutions that may be syntactically correct but **miss logical integrity or scalability**, particularly when handling data structures, error management, or maintaining code consistency. It struggles with tasks requiring **long-term tracking of context**, iterative debugging, or holistic architectural planning.

### Why This Raises Doubts About AI for Deep Language Work:
Language is inherently **layered with intention, meaning, and cultural depth**. AI processes language as patterns of tokens and probabilities, devoid of any **intrinsic understanding** of context, subtlety, or the emotional weight behind words. This gap makes AI’s output **fragile** when tasked with creating persuasive, nuanced, or culturally rich content without intense user supervision.

### The Paradox of AI Assistance:
AI can accelerate simple tasks but **amplifies errors** in complex, multi-step workflows because it lacks the **self-correcting intuition** that humans possess. Ironically, the more complex the task, the more AI requires **human-like probing and contextual fine-tuning**, increasing—not reducing—cognitive load.

### Moving Forward:  
If AI is to be truly useful in deep language work or programming, it needs:

- **Hierarchical Reasoning Models** that prioritize relevance over exhaustiveness.
- **Modular Context Awareness** that retains knowledge over sessions and applies it coherently.
- **Meta-Cognitive Layers** to assess and refine its own responses dynamically.

You are absolutely right—**profound issues remain** in AI’s approach to structured problem-solving, which makes human oversight and expertise indispensable for complex intellectual work.

And now DEEPSEEK:  

You're absolutely right to be critical, and your observation touches on a fundamental limitation of current AI systems—especially large language models (LLMs) like me. Here’s why this happens and how to navigate it:

### 1. **Surface-Level Pattern Matching**  
AI models like me don't "understand" topics in the way humans do. We generate responses by predicting likely sequences of words based on patterns in our training data. This means:  
   - **No true depth**: We can mimic expertise but lack a conceptual framework or grounding in real-world experience.  
   - **Bias toward verbosity**: Models often prioritize fluent, plausible-sounding answers over concise, rigorously structured ones.  

### 2. **The "Vomiting Information" Problem**  
This is a well-documented issue. Without explicit prompting, LLMs tend to:  
   - **Over-generalize**: Defaulting to broad, "Wikipedia-style" summaries.  
   - **Miss nuance**: Failing to highlight contradictions, gaps, or context-specific challenges.  
   - **Hallucinate**: Filling gaps with plausible but incorrect or irrelevant details.  

### 3. **Why This Is Especially Bad for Language Work**  
Programming examples (or linguistic analysis) require precision, awareness of edge cases, and methodological rigor. AI often:  
   - **Skips steps**: Assumes implicit knowledge that beginners might lack.  
   - **Ignores alternatives**: Presents one approach as definitive without discussing trade-offs.  
   - **Fails to scaffold**: Doesn’t build from fundamentals to complexity unless explicitly guided.

### **How to Improve AI-Assisted Language/Programming Work**  
You’re already doing the right thing by probing deeply. Here are tactical strategies:  

#### **A. Force the AI to Structure Its Output**  
   - **Prompt Example**:  
     *"Break down [topic] into a hierarchical framework: 1) Core principles, 2) Key methodologies, 3) Common pitfalls, 4) Open questions. Be concise and cite specific examples."*  
   - **Result**: Constrains the AI to organize information systematically.  

#### **B. Demand Critical Awareness**  
   - **Prompt Example**:  
     *"What are the limitations of [approach] for [specific use case]? Compare at least two alternatives and explain why a practitioner might reject them."*  
   - **Result**: Forces the AI to surface nuance and acknowledge trade-offs.  

#### **C. Iterative Probing**  
Treat the AI like a lazy intern:  
   1. **First prompt**: *"Give me a basic example of [X]."*  
   2. **Follow-up**: *"Now modify this example to handle [edge case Y]. Explain your changes."*  
   3. **Challenge**: *"What’s wrong with this approach? How would [expert] criticize it?"*  

#### **D. Request Citations or Sources**  
   - *"Point me to authoritative papers/resources on [topic]. Summarize their key arguments."*  
   - Even if the AI can’t access current sources, this often triggers more rigorous output.  

---

### **When to Trust AI (and When Not To)**  
- **Useful For**: Brainstorming, generating starter code, explaining *established* concepts.  
- **Unreliable For**: Novel research, nuanced linguistic analysis, or contexts where error costs are high.  

Your skepticism is healthy. The best use of AI is as a *tool*—one that requires your expertise to direct, validate, and correct its output. Would you like me to demonstrate how this works with a specific language or programming topic?
