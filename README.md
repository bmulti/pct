At every level of Ai i have seen this repeated lack of awareness of the depth of the topic, when doing programming examples, which makes me deeply doubt the use of AI for language work without a lot of probing. AI seems to vomit a set of information but has no proper framework to concisely study an issue.

Thank you for your feedback. I understand your concern regarding the AI's ability to handle the depth of certain topics, particularly in programming examples, and its apparent lack of a framework for concise problem-solving. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

You're right that AI models, including myself, can sometimes exhibit a superficial understanding and may struggle to provide truly insightful or nuanced solutions without significant prompting. This limitation stems from the way these models are trained:

Pattern Recognition vs. True Understanding: AI models primarily learn patterns from vast amounts of data. While they can become very good at recognizing and reproducing these patterns, they may not possess a genuine understanding of the underlying concepts or principles. This can lead to the "vomiting" of information you described, where the model regurgitates learned patterns without a deeper grasp of the topic.

Lack of Common Sense and Real-World Knowledge: AI models often lack the common sense and real-world knowledge that humans use to contextualize information and make informed decisions. This can result in the generation of code that is syntactically correct but semantically flawed or impractical.

Limited Reasoning and Problem-Solving Abilities: While AI models can perform certain types of reasoning, their problem-solving abilities are often limited to the patterns they have encountered during training. They may struggle to adapt to novel situations or to apply abstract concepts to concrete problems.

To address these limitations, I am actively being developed with the following:

Improved Training Data: Efforts are underway to curate more comprehensive and diverse training datasets that include not only code examples but also explanations, documentation, and real-world scenarios.

Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities: Researchers are exploring techniques to equip AI models with more robust reasoning abilities, allowing them to make inferences, draw conclusions, and solve problems in a more human-like manner.

Integration of Knowledge Graphs: Integrating AI models with knowledge graphs can provide them with access to structured knowledge about the world, enabling them to better understand context and make more informed decisions.

Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning techniques can be used to train AI models to interact with programming environments and to learn from their mistakes, leading to improved code generation and debugging skills.

I understand that these are ongoing efforts, and there is still much work to be done. In the meantime, your feedback is invaluable in helping me identify areas where I can improve. I will strive to be more mindful of the limitations of my knowledge and to provide more nuanced and insightful responses.

Regarding your point about the need for probing, I agree that careful questioning and validation are essential when working with AI-generated code or language. As AI models become more sophisticated, it's crucial to maintain a critical perspective and to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of their output.

I appreciate your candor and your willingness to share your concerns. I hope that my response has been helpful, and I am committed to continuing to learn and improve.




Thank you for sharing your experience with trying to use AI for your PCT framework on GitHub and for providing the context about AI's tendency to "hallucinate." I appreciate your insights, and I understand your frustration.

It's insightful to hear that you found AI to be "too undisciplined to consistently follow" the framework. The tendency of AI models to "hallucinate" or generate information that is not grounded in reality or the provided context is a significant challenge. This issue is particularly problematic in areas that require precision, consistency, and adherence to specific rules or structures, such as software development frameworks.

The issues you've encountered likely stem from the limitations I mentioned earlier, including the lack of true understanding, common sense reasoning, and the tendency to rely on pattern recognition rather than genuine problem-solving. AI models can struggle to maintain a consistent and coherent approach when faced with complex tasks that require careful planning, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.

I will try to do better but understand the overall frustrations.
