## PCT Document Rules (PCTD)

A. Collate all the comment lines with numbers from all documents and list them, ordered by their numbers in ascending order. Indent the list based on the number of decimal places, making changes in the hierarchy more observable.

B. For comments with backlinks, create an additional list of those comments and make new Backlink Paragraphs. The list should first have the backlink number, followed by the entire comment it came from.

C. Backlinks should be ordered by their numbers and show which code is called by the backlinks.

D. The Document Tree will have a code progression, then a backlink progression, then a linked-to progression.

E. Later rules will include creating a table of variables created and their references (globals, passed, and called variables). A more detailed index of these variables should be documented.
