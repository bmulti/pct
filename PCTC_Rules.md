# PCT (Program Comment Tree) Rules

## PCT Code Rules (PCTC)

1. Numbers in comments must be ascending from the start to the end of the document.

2. The root document has numbers between 0.0001 and 0.9999.

3. Any comments inserted anywhere in the document must have a unique number.

4. The numbers must be sequential but can be any fraction.

5. Numbers must be pure floats and in a formal and pure decimal range.

6. No number should be surrounded by brackets or any similar formatting.

7. All PCTC numbers at the beginning of a comment line must be followed by a space before the actual comment text.

8. Comments without numbers will not be added to the PCTD numbered list.

9. Comments without numbers are useful and will be documented indented in a more detailed analysis of each code document.

10. Markdown (md) formatting may be added only to the comment text and must not be added to any reference number or backlink number.

11. Backlink numbers are preceded always by an equals character and may appear anywhere after the comment number.

12. The numbers must always be pure floats.

13. A backlink reference can be immediately after a comment number if separated by the equals character.

14. All numbers must be pure floats, meaning they must be formal decimal numbers.

15. The document number used can be any integer.

16. In the root document used for coding, the numbers start with the decimal point (e.g., .0001, .9999).

17. The PCT system can have documents with any numbers, but the numbers must stay the same within a PCT document, with the document number preceding the decimal point.

18. The Document reference system can be scaled back to just use whole numbers, so backlinks can just be whole numbers.

19. If a document has PCTC, it must be commented near the top as [PCTC] before any PCTC reference.
